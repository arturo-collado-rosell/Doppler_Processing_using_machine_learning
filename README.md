+ Hello, this document has the objective to guide you through the different python scripts to reproduce the paper results. 
+ In order to use the GPU, you need to install the GPU drivers. If you do not have a GPU, no problem, the code run on CPU too.
+ I strongly recommend the use of an environment to install the different python libraries 
+ In the requirement.txt file you will find the needed libraries to run all scripts. You can install it using pip, e.g. pip install requirement.txt
